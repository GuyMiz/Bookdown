Using this format is supposed to be intuitive, each book will contain chapters, each chapter is a question. Using R bookdown will allow us to show the questions data and principles through both explanations and visualization. Good luck! Guy.

True or false, and explain: the data show that the publics health got worse over the period 1970-2000. 2.2 Answer FALSE Explain: Although the data points towards an overall increase in deaths, it fails to show weather the publics health got worse over that time period. An absolute growth (from 1.9 million to 2.4 million) does not suggest a relative growth. It is safe to assume that the population got bigger as well, which can explain the increase in absolute number of deaths. Lets look at an example of relative and absolute numbers (the population number is just for example): As we can see, although the absolute number of deaths shows an increase of 25%, the relative deaths per population shows a decrease, which contradicts the conclusion that the publics health has got worse. Lets look at the relative numbers: "],["set-a-question-3.html", "3 Set A question 3 3.1 Question 3.2 Answer", " 3 Set A question 3 (Page 21) 3.1 Question Polio is an infectious disease; for example, it seemed to spread when children went swimming together. The NFIP study was not done blind: could that bias the results? Discuss briefly 3.2 Answer Yes, that could create a bias. A study which was not done blind (meaning: the subjects were chosen, not randomly) could have a number of biases for/against the vaccine. If we were to choose children that engage in activites (like swimming) that increased their chances of getting the virus, it would have been a bias against the vaccine.

Furthermore, women who have had a spontaneous abortion are more likely to have another. One observational study finds that women who exercise regularly have fewer spontaneous abortions than other women. Can you explain the findings of this study? 4.2 Answer Women who exercise regularly may not have had any spontaneous abortion in the past, otherwise - they would not have continued to exercise regularly. This study can be explained by the selection process between those women: those who exercise regularly are in good health and did not experience spontaneous abortion until now.

There are 2,000 male applicants, of whom half apply to each department. There are 1,100 female applicants: 100 apply to department A and 1,000 to department B. Department A admits 60% of the men who apply and 60% of the women. Department B admits 30% of the men who apply and 30% of the women. For each department, the percentage of men admitted equals the percentage of women admitted; this must be so for both departments together. True or false, and explain briefly 5.2 Answer FALSE Lets check how many men and women were admitted: We can see that more men were admitted than women, but lets compare the admission percent (divide by number of men or women): Although each department accepted the same percent, with no regard to men/women applicants, higher percentage of men were admitted due to the higher applications for department A (50% of men) comparing to the womens. Department As admission chances were higher (60%) than department Bs, so a higher percentage of men were admitted. "]]
