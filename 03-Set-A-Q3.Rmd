## Question

"Polio is an infectious disease; for example, it seemed to spread when children went swimming together. The
NFIP study was not done blind: could that bias the results? Discuss briefly"

## Answer

**Yes**, that could create a bias. 
A study which was not done blind (meaning: the subjects were chosen, not randomly) could have a number of biases for/against the vaccine. 
If we were to choose children that engage in activites (like swimming) that increased their chances of getting the virus, it would have been a bias against the vaccine.
