## Question 

"Physical exercise is considered to increase the risk of spontaneous abortion. Furthermore, women who have had a spontaneous abortion are more likely to have another. One observational study finds that women who exercise regularly have fewer spontaneous abortions than other women. Can you explain the findings of this study?"

## Answer

Women who exercise regularly may not have had any spontaneous abortion in the past, otherwise - they would not have continued to exercise regularly. This study can be explained by **the selection process** between those women: those who exercise regularly are in good health and did not experience spontaneous abortion until now.
