# Introduction

This is an R bookdown format, which will be used to show examples of answers to questions from the course's book. 
Using this format is supposed to be intuitive, each 'book' will contain chapters, each chapter is a question.

Using R bookdown will allow us to show the question's data and principles through both explanations and visualization. 

**Good luck!**
